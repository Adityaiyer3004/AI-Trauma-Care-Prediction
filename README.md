AI for Trauma Care – Predicting SpO2 Levels Using 1D CNN
--------------------------------------------------------

🚀 Developed a high-accuracy AI model for real-time trauma care insights in collaboration with London Air Ambulance.

Project Overview
----------------
This project, part of my MSc dissertation at Queen Mary University of London, focuses on 
predicting SpO2 levels in trauma patients using a 1D CNN model. The AI model assists emergency 
responders at London Air Ambulance by providing real-time insights into patient oxygen levels, 
improving trauma care decision-making.

🚨 Important Disclaimer
-----------------------
The dataset used in this project is private due to medical confidentiality.
👉 Only the model implementation notebook is provided—no data preprocessing scripts or raw data 
   are shared.
